# Friday Night Funkin' - Bird Engine

![Bird Engine Banner](art/bde_banner.png)

Want to use Codename Engine but you want to use Lua (hi psych users :3) or are you still learning Haxe (for HScript)? This is the perfect fork to start with.

Based on Codename Engine, this custom engine includes:

- Full Lua Script support over OOP-like programming **(i.e. Not compatible with Psych Lua)**
  - Gameplay Scripting
  - Customizable States/Substates (and Custom ones too)

## Based on Codename Engine

Codename Engine is a cross platform [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) Engine aimed at simplifying modding focusing on softcoding, along with extensiblity and ease of use.<br>
It is the the official successor of the previously well known [Yoshi Engine](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/YoshiCrafterEngine).

The engine uses [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) and it mainly features:
- A full scripting system with an optimized fork of [Hscript](https://lib.haxe.org/p/hscript/) (its name is [Hscript Improved](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/hscript-improved))
- Uses forks of popular libraries tailored specifically for the engine for the goal of better optimization.
- Modding system and softcoding is as capable as source coding.
- Focuses heavily on optimization, and encourages its users to also take on optimization practices.
- Many modding tools without changing the core gameplay and the base to mod on.
- Allows modularity using addons and mods that apply on top of the core mod.
- Advanced editors which allows for possibly better experience and easiness when creating the mod.
- Much more can be read [HERE](FEATURES.md)
